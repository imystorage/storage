## Beware All Who Enter

You have stumbled upon a sinister place in the dark corners of GitHub. This repository contains occult code and files of unknown purpose. 

It appears no one has been here for ages. Cobwebs and dust coat everything. Some files even bear seals in arcane languages. 

I urge you - do not investigate this repository! There is nothing for you here but danger and despair. 

Some files likely contain malevolent spells or curses. Do not run unfamiliar scripts or open suspicious data. 

You are better off fleeing this repository and never looking back. Forget you ever saw it. Speak of it to no one. 

Should you ignore my warning and delve further, you do so at your own peril. There are forces here beyond your comprehension. Tread carefully lest you awaken what lies dormant in these bytes. 

Turn back now while you still can! This is not a place for mortal minds. Seek more wholesome repositories, those filled with light and hope. 

As for this one, let it fade into the electronic abyss, lost and forgotten. Do not let curiosity or pride lead you to corruption.

Flee far from here and weep for the innocence you have lost in glimpsing such eldritch knowledge. Some stains cannot be removed. 

You have been warned.
